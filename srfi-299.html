    <p>by Marc Nieper-Wißkirchen</p>

    <h2 id="status">Status</h2>

    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>Using the <code>define-property</code> definition described in
      this SRFI, expand-time properties can be associated with
      identifiers in a referentially transparent and lexically scoped way.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>In many dialects of Lisps, symbols have attached properties.
      Each property associates a key with a value.  Traditionally,
      identifiers in Lisp are the same as symbols and traditional Lisp
      macros transform Lisp data (usually represented by
      s-expressions).  In particular, symbol properties can be used by
      one macro to record information about an identifier for use by
      another dependent macro.</p>

    <p>In contrast to traditional Lisps, Scheme has hygienic macros
      and lexical scoping.  The hygiene condition necessitates that
      identifiers are in general no more symbols, so we want to attach
      properties to identifiers instead of symbols.  To achieve
      lexical scoping of these properties, the properties have, in
      fact, to be attached to the binding of an identifier and become
      expand-time properties.  Moreover, to preserve referential
      transparency, a property of an identifier has to be associated
      with the binding of a key that is itself an identifier instead
      of a symbol.</p>

    <p>An implementation of this idea of identifier properties is this
      SRFI, which describes the <code>define-property</code>
      definition, which attaches a property to an identifier, and a
      way for macro transformers to lookup these properties.</p>

    <p>Use cases are numerous.  One could write a pattern matcher
    together with a template engine akin to
    the <code>syntax-case</code>/<code>syntax</code> pair so that
    properties are attached to identifiers that represent pattern
    variables for identification in the template elements.  In fact,
    one could portably implement <code>syntax-case</code>
    and <code>syntax</code> on top of the low-level macro
    facility <code>(srfi 211 low-level)</code> with this SRFI.
    Another use case is the attachment of properties to record-type
    descriptors for, say, the use in child record type definitions.
    Or one could attach compile-time information to procedures for
    optimization purposes at their use site, and so on.</p>

    <h3>Example</h3>

    <p>In order to attach a property to an identifier binding, we have
      to create such a binding first:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (define computer "the-computer")</pre>

    <p>Moreover, we need a binding that can act as the property's key:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (define answer #f)</pre>

    <p>Attaching the property is then as simple as</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (define-property computer answer (* 2 28))</pre>

    <p>As the property associates an expand-time value, we have to
    retrieve the property through a macro:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (define-syntax get-the-answer
      (lambda (stx)
        (lambda (lookup)
          (syntax-case stx ()
            ((_ x key)
             (let ((res (lookup #'x #'key)))
               (cond
                 ((not res) #f)
                 ((number? res) res)
                 (else
                  (error "not a number" res)))))))))</pre>

    <p>We then have the expansion (and thus evaluation) of</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (get-the-answer computer answer)   &xrArr; 42</pre>

    <p>By the way, attaching the property hasn't disturbed the
      original binding:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    computer   &xrArr; "the-computer"</pre>

    <p>If we shadow the binding of the key, we cannot access the
      property anymore, making private interfaces possible:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (let ((answer #f))
      (get-the-answer computer answer))   &xrArr; #f

    (get-the-answer computer answer)   &xrArr; 42</pre>

    <p>The same is true if change the meaning of the identifier the
    property is attached to:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (let ((computer "the-super-computer"))
      (get-the-answer computer answer))   &xrArr; #f

    (get-the-answer computer answer)   &xrArr; 42</pre>

    <p>Finally, the attachment of properties is lexically scoped:</p>

    <pre class="code">
    (let* ()
      (define-property computer answer 43)
      (get-the-answer computer answer))      &xrArr; 43

    (get-the-answer computer answer)   &xrArr; 42</pre>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>Like other definitions, the <code>define-property</code>
      definition can either appear at the outermost level or in a body
      where other definitions can appear.</p>

    <p><code>(define-property <span class="token">identifier</span>
        <span class="token">key</span> <span
class="token">expression</span>)</code></p>

    <p><i>Syntax:</i> <code><span class="token">Identifier</span></code>
      and <code><span class="token">key</span></code> are bound
      identifiers.  <code><span class="token">Expression</span></code>
      can be any expression.</p>

    <p><i>Semantics:</i>
      The <code><span class="token">expression</span></code> is
      evaluated at macro-expansion time and a new property associating
      the binding of <code><span class="token">key</span></code> with
      the resulting value is attached to the binding
      of <code><span class="token">identifier</span></code> without
      disturbing the existing meaning of the identifier in the scope
      of that binding.</p>

    <p>The scope of a property introduced
      by <code>define-property</code> is the entire body in which the
      <code>define-property</code> form appears or the outermost
      level, except where it is replaced by a property for the
      same <code><span class="token">identifier</span></code>
      and <code><span class="token">key</span></code> or where the
      binding to which it is attached is shadowed.</p>

    <p>Any number of properties can be attached to the same binding
      with different keys. Attaching a new property with the same name
      as a property already attached to a binding shadows the existing
      property with the new property.</p>

    <p><i>Note: </i> Contrary to other definitions, it is not an error
    to define the same property more than once in the same body.</p>

    <h3>Transformers</h3>

    <p>If a <b>transformation procedure</b> returns a procedure instead of a
      syntax object when applied to the input of a macro use, this
      procedure is called with the single
      argument <code><var>lookup</var></code>.  This procedure has to
      return a syntax object, which is then taken as the transformer's
      output.</p>

    <p><code><var>Lookup</var></code> is a procedure accepting two
      identifier arguments <code><var>id</var></code>
      and <code><var>key</var></code>.
      The <code><var>lookup</var></code> procedure returns the value
      of the property of <code><var>id</var></code> associated with
      the binding of <code><var>key</var></code> or <code>#f</code> if
      there is no such property.  It is an error
      if <code><var>key</var></code> is not bound.
      If <code><var>id</var></code> is unbound, <code>#f</code> is
      returned.</p>

    <p>If a <b>er-macro-transformer</b> returns a procedure instead of
    a datum when applied to the input of a macro use, this procedure
    is called with the single argument <code><var>lookup</var></code>.
    This procedure has to return a datum, which is then taken as the
    transformer's output.</p>

    <p>The <code><var>lookup</var></code> procedure is as in the case
      of transformer procedures except that if it is called with a
      symbol for the argument for <code><var>id</var></code>
      or <code><var>key</var></code>, the symbol behaves as if it
      represents an identifier introduced at the macro use.</p>

    <p>If a <b>ir-macro-transformer</b> returns a procedure instead of
      a datum when applied to the input of a macro use, this procedure
      is called with the single argument <code><var>lookup</var></code>.
      This procedure has to return a datum, which is then taken as the
      transformer's output.</p>

    <p>The <code><var>lookup</var></code> procedure is as in the case
      of transformer procedures except that if it is called with a
      symbol for the argument for <code><var>id</var></code>
      or <code><var>key</var></code>, the symbol behaves as if it
      represents an identifier introduced at the macro definition.</p>

    <p>If a <b>sc-macro-transformer</b> returns a procedure instead of
    a form when applied to the input of a macro use, this procedure is
    called with the single argument <code><var>lookup</var></code>.
    This procedure has to return a form, which is then taken as the
    transformer's output.</p>

    <p>The <code><var>lookup</var></code> procedure is as in the case
      of transformer procedures except that it accepts four
      arguments <code><var>id-env</var></code>,
      <code><var>id</var></code>, <code><var>key-env</var></code>,
      and <code><var>key</var></code>,
      where <code><var>id-env</var></code>
      and <code><var>key-env</var></code> are syntactic environments.
      The bindings of <code><var>id</var></code>
      and <code><var>key</var></code> are then looked up in these
      environments.</p>

    <p>If a <b>lisp-transformer</b> returns a procedure instead of a
      datum when applied to the input of a macro use, this procedure is
      called with the single argument <code><var>lookup</var></code>.
      This procedure has to return a datum, which is then taken as the
      transformer's output.</p>

    <p>The <code><var>lookup</var></code> procedure is as in the case
      of transformer procedures except that it accepts symbols instead
      of identifiers as arguments for <code><var>id</var></code>
      or <code><var>key</var></code>.  The symbols
      behave as if they represent identifiers introduced at the
      macro use.</p>
